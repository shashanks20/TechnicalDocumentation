            <section class="main-section" id="Introduction"><header>Introduction</header><p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p><p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java"><header>JavaScript and Java</header><p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p><p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p></section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world"><header>Hello world</header><p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code</p><div><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code></div></section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Data_types"><header>Data types</header><p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p><ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul></section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Constants"><header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <div>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code></div>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                <div>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }</code></div>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <div>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";</code></div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations"><header>Function declarations</header><p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p><ul>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
            <div><code>return number * number;</code></div>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
